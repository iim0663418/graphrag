{"result": "Distributed Processing is a capability that enables data to be processed across multiple systems, particularly within large-scale knowledge graphs. This approach is essential for scaling GraphRAG systems, allowing them to efficiently handle millions of entities and their relationships. By leveraging distributed architectures, the system ensures scalability, performance, and robustness in managing complex, interconnected data environments.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
