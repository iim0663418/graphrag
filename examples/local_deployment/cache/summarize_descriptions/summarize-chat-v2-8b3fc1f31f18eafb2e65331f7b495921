{"result": "DATABASE PARTITIONING is a technical strategy designed to scale GraphRAG systems by distributing large knowledge graphs across distributed systems. This approach enables efficient handling of large-scale knowledge graphs by partitioning data in a manner that supports scalability, performance, and manageability across multiple system nodes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
