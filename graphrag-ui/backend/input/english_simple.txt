Microsoft GraphRAG is a powerful knowledge graph construction tool. It uses large language models to extract entities and relationships from unstructured text.

The system works by chunking documents and using LLMs to identify entities like people, organizations, and locations. It also extracts relationships between these entities.

GraphRAG can be integrated with local models using LMStudio, providing a cost-effective alternative to cloud APIs. This allows organizations to process sensitive data locally while maintaining privacy.

The indexing process creates multiple output files including parquet files that store the extracted knowledge graph data.
